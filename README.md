# [K]eep [I]t [S]tupid [S]imple Design System

---

The KISS Design System is a simple, easy-to-use design system that is built to be used by developers and designers
alike. It is built with simplicity in mind, and is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. The library is
build upon web standards and best practices, based only upon HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no dependencies on any other
libraries or frameworks.

However, the source code itself is written in Typescript, to ensure a maximal level of maintainability and scalability.
The library is built with a focus on performance, and is designed to be as lightweight as possible, with a minimal
footprint on the page.

It consists in three parts:

- A global CSS that provides a set of basic styles for typography, colors, buttons, forms, and other common elements,
  based on CSS custom properties, that can be all overwritten to suit your needs.
- A web components library that provides a set of custom elements that can be used to build complex user interfaces,
  such as modals, tabs, accordions, and more.
- A showcasing application that demonstrates how to use the design system in a real-world application, provides the
  documentation and the playground to test the components.
